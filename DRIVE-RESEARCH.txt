ATTITUDE CONTROLLER
    Quaternion Station Keeping

TRANSLATION CONTROLLER
    PID Control along current body frame
    
CONTROL ALLOCATOR
    THRUSTER LOOKUP TABLE
        retain pure translation and rotation
    [ F_c; T_c ] = [ H_f; H_t ] * x_bar
        where
        x_min <= x_i <= x_max, for i = 1,...,n
    
    6xn distribution matrix H. top half based on geometry of how forces are imparted, and bottom on how torques are imparted
    Column vector x contains thrust values which are non-zero and cannot exceed known maximum or below x_min
